##Peter Hinton
##This is a program where you have two options, to type a word, and have it scramble it for you, or have it pick a random word.
##I probably will not make the word library very large, because I don't need to. I might have one of my siblings type in a word
##for me to try and unscramble.

##I will start with a user input word to scramble.

words = ["unbelievable", "extraordinary", "unfortunate", "incompatible", "contemporary", "imagination", "celebrations", "unscrambled",
"unsupportive", "disastrously"] ##Yes. I used AI for these...
